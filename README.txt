Project Title: Video Processing and Steganography

Description:
This project involves video processing techniques in Python, including text extraction, embedding, and ArUco marker detection.

Features:
- Extracts text from an image and embeds it across video frames.
- Detects and overlays images on ArUco markers in real-time video.

Files:
- encode.py: Script for encoding and embedding text in video.
- decode.py: Script for decoding and extracting embedded text from video.


An ArUco marker is a type of binary square marker thatâ€™s widely used in computer vision for object tracking, augmented reality, and robotics applications. They are often used to detect and determine the position and orientation of objects in space.
